# CAPTCHA_website

honours website/2023

The VS code files are all over the place, will reorganize/restructure for website 3.0.

This piece touches on two increasingly common elements of our culture - the ability to track and codify humans in more intimate and often invasive ways (as data collection to further improve the accuracy/efficiency of synthetic media) and also the changing power dynamic between humans and computers.

The website acts to facilitate the function of the CAPTCHA style interaction. Humans proving 'human-ness' to computers, the power dynamic of a computer validating a human through a series of 'tests' that are simple enough for most humans to complete but too difficult for computers.

CAPTCHA has also been through a series of iterations due to computers learing and getting too good at current CAPTCHAS so there is an element of speculative design in this project looking at potential future CAPTCHAs.

The CAPTCHA process allows me to explore the overarching idea of the project; the introduction of synthetic media (any media created partially or fully using machine learning algorithms). Its the next stage of media creation (old media > new media > synthetic media) and includes things like GAAN deepfakes, runway, social media facial filters, facial recognition, ect. The rise of synthetic media is foreshadowing the computer's self autonomy and ability to create content and decisions completely independently of human control. 

CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Process Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. As computer's rapidly learn how to create synthetic representations of the human condition the ability to tell computers and humans apart will become increasingly difficult.

The speculative CAPTCHA I want to showcase in the website implements synthetic media to tell computers and humans apart and represents a procession of human codification. Previous versions of CAPTCHA have been used to train machine models (Google's reCAPTCHA of identifying images of street objects (traffic lights, other cars, pedestrain crossings, ect.) was used to train google map algorithms and self driving cars) and as synthetic media becomes increasingly mainstream the requirement for more subtle and nueanced capturing and reflection of humans will occur.
