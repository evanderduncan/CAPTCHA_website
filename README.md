# CAPTCHA_website
honours website/2023

The VS code files are all over the place, will reorganize/restructure for website 3.0.

The website acts to facilitate the function of the CAPTCHA style interaction. Humans proving 'human-ness' to computers, the power dynamic of a computer validating a human through a series of 'tests' that are simple enough for most humans to complete but too difficult for computers.

CAPTCHA has also been through a series of iterations due to computers learing and getting too good at current CAPTCHAS so there is an element of speculative design in this project looking at potential future CAPTCHAs.

ouse the concept of synthetic media (any media created partially or fully using machine learning algorithms) 



This piece touches on two increasingly common elements of our culture - the ability to track and codify in more intimate and often invasive ways (as data collection to further improve the accuracy/efficiency of synthetic media) and also the changing power dynamic between humans and computers. The rise of synthetic media is foreshadowing the computer's self-determination.

Captcha stands for completely automated Process turing test to tell computers and humans apart.
